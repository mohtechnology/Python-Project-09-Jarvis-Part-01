# Jarvis Part - 01
Welcome to Part 1 of our series on designing Jarvis in Python! In this video, weâ€™ll start building our very own virtual assistant. This part covers the basics and sets up the foundation for more advanced features in future videos.

## In this tutorial, we will:
- Set up the Python environment.
- Install necessary libraries.
  ```python
  pip install speechRecognition
  ```
  ```python
  pip install pywin32
  ```
  ```python

- Create a basic structure for our Jarvis project.
- Implement a simple greeting function.
